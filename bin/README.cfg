         This is a description of the configuration file for SimpleHTTPd
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Naming Conventions, File Search
        When the SimpleHTTPd server is started, the configuration file
        is located by this scheme. The numbers show the priority - if
        a file can be found by one method, all other (following) methods
        are skiped:
                1) If '-cfg FILE' parameter is given, this file
                   name is used.
                2) Else the default file name 'httpd.cfg' in the
                   current path is used.
                3) If a file for method (1) or (2) is found, it
                   is taken.
                4) Else the location of the executable (OS/2, WIN32)
                   is detected, the name of the executable is trun-
                   cated and 'httpd.cfg' is added to the path.
                5) On any else machine, not mentioned in (4), a
                   default '/etc/httpd.cfg' is set.
                6) The file for method (4) or (5) is tried to
                   be processed.



Syntax
        The file is split in various groups with group members. The
        structure is like this:
                [group_name_1]
                        group_1_parameter_1
                        group_1_parameter_2
                        group_1_parameter_3
                        ...
                [group_name_2]
                        group_2_parameter_1:value
                        group_2_parameter_2:value
                        ...
                ...

        Remarks ...
                - everything behind a '#' is treated as remark,
                - there is no escape sequence for the '#' symbol.

        Group names ...
                - must contain only one word, no spaces or white-spaces,
                - are case-insensitive,
                - are enclosed in '[' and ']',
                - leading blanks and white-spaces in front of '[' or in
                  front of the group name are skiped,
                - on writing, no leading white-space or blank is added.

        Parameters ...
                - are case-insensitive,
                - are delimited to one line,
                - are case-insensitive,
                - may have only a parameter or a parameter-value pair,
                - leading blanks and white-spaces at start of the line
                  are ignored,
                - on writing, a leading white-space (\t) is added.



Contents:
        Group '[admin]'
                - 'sequence:<sequence_id>'
                  ... used for update sequence detection.

        Group '[FILE]'
                - '{<name_of_default_file>}+'
                  ... lines containing files to be used on module 'FILE',
                  when the given file could not be found. This file will
                  be added to the given path and then it will be checked,
                  if such a file exists in that path.
                - '{.<extension>:<MIME_type>}:<opts>+'
                  ... gives the MIME type (main/sub type) of an extension.
                  Extensions *must* start with a dot ('.') - else the line
                  will not be recognized! '<opts>' describes the options
                  for this MIME type as word, where each (unique) character
                  has a certain meaning:
                    'c' = type is possible candidate for on-the-fly data
                          compression - if this is set, 'c' is set for the
                          according entry in the '[paths]' group and the
                          browser supports on-the-fly compression, on-the-
                          fly compression is okay.

        Group '[main]'
                - 'admin:<eMail>'
                  ... specifies the eMail address for the web server
                  administrator. On default, 'webmaster@<name_of_machine>'
                  is used.

                - 'host:<name>'
                  ... specifies the name of the machine. On default,
                  the name of the web server machine is tried to be
                  queried from the TCP/IP sub-system.

        Group '[modules]'
                - '{<module_name>}+'
                  ... gives line by line a list of external modules to
                  be loaded. The file name may vary to the module name,
                  depending to the operating system - the file name may
                  have a pre- and a postfix, i.e.
                    module_file_name ::= prefix + module_name + postfix

        Group '[paths]'
                - '{<path>|<ext>|<security>|<module>|<opts>|<re-map>}+'
                    ^      ^     ^          ^        ^      ^

                    |      or empty (no limit on ext.)

                    start of path, if '<path>' is '/abc', all given paths
                    starting with this string (e.g. '/abcde', '/abc/')
                    will match - if set empty, all paths match.

                  Notes:
                    1) If <path> and <ext> are both empty, the line matches
                       all requests --> default entry.
                    2) If <path> is empty by <ext> not, the line matches all
                       requests having the extension - all beyond the exten-
                       sion is treated as path extension (= extra parameter).
                    3) If <path> is not empty, but <ext>, the line matches
                       all requests with a path having the same characters at
                       the start as <path>.
                    4) If both <path> and <ext> are not empty, the line mat-
                       ches requests with a path like (3) and an extension
                       like (2).
                    5) <security> contains the name of a group where-under
                       the valid access users are listed.
                    6) Module names starting with 'MOD_...' are external
                       (shared libraries, DLLs - user defined), all others
                       internal, with predefined purposes (not user defined).
                    *) The '<opts>' field is a variable length field with
                       options. Each option is represented by a single uni-
                       que character (case-sensitive) - valid options and
                       characters are:
                         'c' = enable on-the-fly compression if possible
                         's' = use path only with SSL data encryption,
                               deny access when no encryption is enabled

        Group '[security]'
                - '{<security>}+'
                  ... line by line a list of available security schemes.

        Group '[SEC_...]'
                - '{<user_name>:<encrypted_password>}+'
                    ^           ^
                    |           |
                    name of     crypt() or fcrypt()
                    user        compatible format,
                                '*' if disabled

                  Notes:
                    1) The user name may contain blanks but no TABs, e.g.
                       'ohme' or 'Dirk Ohme' are both valid entries.
                    2) An entry may be disabled by setting the password en-
                       try to '*'.
                    3) If an entry goes like this,
                                <user_name>:*:<password>
                        this means for HttpSaveCfg() shall do the password
                        encryption (<password> is not encrypted).
