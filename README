    This is the latest info about SimpleHTTPd and its use under various OS.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use under ...
        IBM OS/2
          - requires OS/2 2.x with TCP/IP 2.0,, Warp 3.0 with IAK (Inter-
            net Access Kit), Warp 3.0 Connect (with TCP/IP installed) or
            Warp 4.0 (with TCP/IP installed).

        Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT, Windows 2000
          - requires MS Win 95, 98, NT or 2000 (i.e. WIN32-API)
          - requires Windows Sockets (TCP/IP) installed
          - no support for old Windows 3.x!

        Unix
          - requires a Unix on a - at least - 32 bit architecture
          - requires a ANSI-C compatible compiler for re-compilation,
            best is gcc with ANSI-C libraries
          - should work with IBM AIX, HP/UX, Linux, Sun Solaris 1 & 2, etc.



Notes on IBM OS/2:
        - dynamic re-configuration should work, but I don't know how to
          send a SIGHUP to the process?! ;-)
        - dynamic re-configuration via online administration works without
          such problems
        - no support for services (options '-register', '-unregister')!



Notes on Microsoft Windows (32 bit):
        - no support for SIGHUP, i.e. dynamic re-configuration by sending
          a signal to the process doesn't work
        - dynamic re-configuration via online administration works without
          such problems
        - in order to shut down a session, started from a command prompt
          (CMD.EXE or COMMAND.COM window/full-screen), you'd better prefer
          pressing CTRL-BREAK (not CTRL-C)!
        - when installing as a service:
           1) services are only available under Windows NT & 2000, but
              not under Windows 95, nor Windows 98!
           2) you have to be the system administrator to use '-register'
              and '-unregister' !!!
           3) you may have to check the settings in the windows setup
              ('services'), especially the startup-type



Notes on Unix:
        - no support for services (options '-register', '-unregister')!
        - when doing a recompile, please process these steps:
           1) sh config.sh
           2) make convert
           3) make clean all
          This is necessary in order to make the sources conforming to
          Unix again.
        - you may edit the Makefile.UNX with the editor 'vi' *only* !!!



Known Bugs, Restrictions:
        - Netscape 4.x (all versions?) seem to have a big problem with HTML
          forms, if the contents is returns via HTTP method POST. Then, when
          the length of the data exceeds 88 characters, the 88th character
          is overritten by a ASCII NUL (0x00) character. You will see the
          result, when you enter the administration section of access paths
          and you change a path - if a character mysteriously disappears in
          the translated path section, then the bug takes affect!

          To solve this problem, SimpleHTTPd uses HTTP method GET instead of
          POST within the online administration.               (28. Dec. 1998)

        - Any other bugs and limitations: See online documentation.
